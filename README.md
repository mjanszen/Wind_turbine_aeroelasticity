# Wind_turbine_aeroelasticity
Homework assignments for TU Delft's Wind turbine aeroelasticity class in Q4 2023.


## To-do's:

- Implement the steady case (considering the blade pitch as a function of the wind speed
- Check the blade pitch in the unsteady conditions 
- Remove initial transient from the structure response signal
- compute time lag response and loads
- Reporting: describe the structural model
- Reporting: write section about the interpolation of the loads 
- Reporting: write section on the transient, frequency components and the lag
